Did you have time to complete the coding test?
Yes, we managed to complete all the tasks in the coding test.

What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
Given more time, I'd focus on enhancing the user experience. For example, implementing more robust error handling, adding real-time updates using WebSockets, improving the UI/UX design, state management using Redux and adding more authentication and authorization features.

How would you optimize your solution?
To optimize the solution, I'd implement server-side and client-side caching, use database indexing for better query performance, minimize network requests, and utilize lazy loading and code splitting to reduce bundle size.

What are the security issues you can see in your solution?
There are a few potential security issues, such as lack of input validation and authentication, express not using HTTPS, exposure of sensitive information, and vulnerability certain website attacks.

How does your solution handle concurrency to maintain correct ordering of transfers?
Currently, the solution doesn't address concurrency explicitly. To maintain correct ordering, you could implement optimistic concurrency control or use database transactions to handle concurrent updates to user balances.

List a few of your preferred JavaScript frameworks and specify when you'd choose to use them.
I prefer React for building SPAs, Express.js for server-side applications, Vue.js for smaller projects or simpler interfaces, and Nest.js for scalable server-side applications with TypeScript. The choice depends on factors like project requirements and team expertise.
